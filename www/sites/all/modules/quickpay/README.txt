OVERVIEW
========

This module works with the Danish payment gateway provider QuickPay.dk
allowing you to receive payments using the payment options supported
by QuickPay on your Drupal site.

It includes a sub modules to implement the gateway into a shop based
on the Commerce package.

Development of these modules has been sponsored by QuickPay themselves.

=== WARNING ===

While these modules are as plug and play as is possible, setting up
online payment requires some insight into Drupal, payment gateways and
PBS requirements, and is not for the casual user. If in doubt, consult
a professional.

Using quickpay.module in a custom Drupal solution
=================================================

The core module can be used as a payment gateway in a custom written
(ie. not using Commerce or another supported package) Drupal
solution.
